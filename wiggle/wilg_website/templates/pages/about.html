<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>The Women's Independent Living Group (WILG) is one of the few all-women housing options at MIT. We're an independent
    living group that houses about 45 residents. WILG was founded with the belief that a group of hard-working women can
    manage their own house, and we've been doing just that for almost 40 years.</p>
